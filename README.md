The code contained in this package is a result of searching for a way to implement a meter with a gradient background, but with a reveal based on a set inner width. The result is animated, layered HTML elements designed to mimick the html meter / progress tag.

The CSS code and HTML layout provided has been edited from its original form. Both the CSS and HTML layout was designed by Chris Coyier @ [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com).

These bars have been designed to 'reveal' a gradient that is hidden. The idea came about while working with a strength meter. The built HTML meter tag has the not the capability to reveal a section of the bar, nor does it allow full gradient spanning while having a visual indicator on the meter. These bars consist of 4 layers. Layer one contains a full spanning gradient, from red to green. Layer two consists of a striped layer with transparency. Layer three consists of cover, that reveals the gradients below. The last layer is a text layer that can always be seen.
